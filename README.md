# Basic VLAN Trunking - Cisco Packet Tracer Project

## üìö Project Overview
This project simulates **VLAN trunking** between two Cisco switches using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The objective is to allow devices in the same VLAN (but connected to different switches) to communicate through a trunk link.

## üîß Files in the Repository
| File                    | Description |
|------------------|----------------|
| `basic-trunking.pkt` | Cisco Packet Tracer file with the full topology. |
| `vlan_config.txt` | All configuration commands applied on both switches. |
| `README.md` | Full project documentation. |

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Open `basic-trunking.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review the `vlan_config.txt` to understand the switch configurations.
3. Use these commands in Packet Tracer to check:
    - `show vlan brief`
    - `show interfaces trunk`
4. Test **ping** between devices in the same VLAN (across the two switches) to confirm successful trunking.
5. The **native VLAN** is set to VLAN 99 to demonstrate how to change the default.
